## üìã Output Format Example üìã

If you select `src/utils.ts` and `styles/main.css`, the "Copy" command gives you this on the clipboard:

```markdown
---
---
file: utils.ts
\`\`\`typescript
// src/utils.ts
export function helperFunction(param: string): string {
  return `Processed: ${param}`;
}
\`\`\`
---

\-\-\-
file: main.css
\`\`\`css
/* styles/main.css */
body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  color: #333;
}
\`\`\`
---
---
```

The "Open" command opens a new tab with this content:

```markdown
<codes-list>
---
file: utils.ts
```typescript
// src/utils.ts
export function helperFunction(param: string): string {
  return `Processed: ${param}`;
}
```
---

---
file: main.css
```css
/* styles/main.css */
body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  color: #333;
}
```
---
</codes-list>
```

*(Note the surrounding `<codes-list>` tags added by the "Open" command, potentially useful for specific parsing needs or just structure in the editor).*
